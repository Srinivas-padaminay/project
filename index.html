                     <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931,</b> to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Isla
                     then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque 
                     his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited 


                   Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family and His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners 
                   with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim
                   from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from  
                   as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the 
                   failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the 
                   was born.  As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income. 

                          In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire
                    to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.[21] After completing his education  at Schwartz Higher Secondary 
                   School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend the St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli from  where he graduated in Physics in 1954.
